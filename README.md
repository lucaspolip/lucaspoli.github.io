## 🧭 Summary

I am a political economist specializing in **water quality, sanitation, and resilient infrastructure** in Latin America and the Caribbean.  
My work focuses on how **institutional design, regulatory incentives, and behavioral factors** shape service continuity and environmental outcomes.  
At the **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)**, I co-author research on **water contamination, efficiency, and strategic regulatory compliance** by utilities.  
I hold an **MSc in Political Economy** from the London School of Economics (with Distinction) and dual bachelor’s degrees in **Economics** (PUC-SP) and **Social Sciences** (USP).

**Current focus areas:**
- Resilient infrastructure for water and sanitation  
- Governance and accountability in utility regulation  
- Empirical methods for service continuity and contamination risk  
- Behavioral and institutional drivers of service performance

## 📚 Research

### Selected Work

- **Strategic Oversampling and Regulatory Evasion in Brazil’s Water Sector** *(forthcoming, IDB)*  
  Examines how Brazilian utilities strategically oversample clean sites to avoid contamination penalties.  
  Uses stochastic frontier models to measure efficiency and compliance behavior.

- **Water Contamination and Learning Outcomes in Brazil** *(work in progress, IDB)*  
  Estimates the causal impact of water contamination on student test performance using a staggered difference-in-differences design.

- **Regulating Water Quality in Latin America and the Caribbean** *(2024, IDB Flagship Report)*  
  Co-authored cross-country analysis on the alignment of national water quality standards with WHO guidelines.  
  Developed a regional index to benchmark regulatory stringency and enforcement.

- **Forecasting Urban Crime with Machine Learning** *(Centre for Economic Performance, LSE)*
